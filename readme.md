# ElectricalHarmonicDrive

## Overview
ElectricalHarmonicDrive is an innovative electromagnetic wave drive based on permanent magnets, developed as a bachelor's thesis project at the National Technical University of Ukraine "Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute". This project combines the principles of wave reduction and electromechanical energy conversion to create a high-torque, low-speed actuator with unique capabilities.

The drive offers numerous advantages over traditional motor-gearbox systems including smaller dimensions, lower moment of inertia, position fixation when power is removed, and the ability to create multi-wave mechanical systems.

## Key Features
- High torque output (up to 160 N·m) at low speeds (9.48 RPM)
- Precise positioning with step size of 0.85°
- Position fixation when power is removed (without the need for a brake)
- Zero backlash design for high precision motion
- Ability to support multiple mechanical waves (2-4)
- Compact design compared to traditional motor-gearbox systems

## Technologies
- Electromagnetic wave drive with permanent magnets
- Strain wave gear technology (harmonic drive)
- Finite element analysis (COMSOL Multiphysics 5.4)
- Mathematical modeling (Matlab 2020a)
- Electromagnetic and mechanical calculations

## Technical Specifications
- Maximum torque: 160 N·m (with 4-wave configuration)
- Rotation speed: 9.48 RPM
- Step size: 0.85°
- Power: 160W (with 4-wave configuration)
- Position fixation: Yes, when power is removed

## Working Principle
The system combines wave reduction principles with electromechanical energy conversion. It consists of:
1. A group of coils wound on a core made of composite electrical steel
2. A reaction element with permanent magnets
3. A flexible element with both internal and external teeth
4. External and internal rigid gears
5. Housing

The system controls magnetic flux paths to create attraction and repulsion forces, deforming the flexible element in a wave pattern. This creates mechanical torque through precise engagement of gear teeth, providing high reduction ratios and zero backlash operation.
